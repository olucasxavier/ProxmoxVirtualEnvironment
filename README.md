# Proxmox Virtual Environment

Welcome to my Proxmox exploration project! In this repository, I'll take you on a journey through the fascinating world of virtualization, containers and cybersecurity, as I deploy Proxmox in my homelab environment.

<h3>WHAT IS PROXMOX?</h3>

Proxmox is an open-source virtualization platform that combines two powerful virtualization technologies: KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) for virtual machines and LXC (Linux Containers) for lightweight containerization. It's a robust, feature-rich solution that provides an ideal playground for honing your virtualization skills.

<h3>WHY PROXMOX?</h3>

Virtualization is a fundamental technology in today's IT landscape, and Proxmox stands out as a versatile and user-friendly platform for virtualization enthusiasts and professionals alike. With Proxmox, I can create and manage virtual machines and containers, experiment with various operating systems, and build complex network topologies - all within the confines of my homelab.

<h3>PROJECT GOALS</h3>

<b>Hands-on Learning:</b> I will document my journey as I set up Proxmox and delve into its various features. This project will serve as a comprehensive guide for anyone looking to get started with Proxmox or deepen their virtualization expertise.

<b>Cybersecurity Focus:</b> In addition to virtualization, I'll explore the cybersecurity aspects of Proxmox. This includes securing the Proxmox environment, implementing network security measures, and using Proxmox as a platform for testing and experimenting with cybersecurity tools and techniques.

<b>Homelab Expansion:</b> I'll share insights into my homelab setup, including the hardware and network configurations, to provide a real-world context for this project. You'll see how Proxmox fits into the larger ecosystem of my homelab.

<h3>WHAT TO EXPECT</h3>

<b>Experiments:</b> Follow along as I conduct cybersecurity experiments using Proxmox, such as setting up vulnerable machines for penetration testing and exploring malware analysis in isolated environments.

<b>Contributions Welcome:</b> I encourage contributions, feedback, and collaboration from the community. If you have suggestions, improvements, or questions, please feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.

Join me in this exciting journey to explore virtualization and cybersecurity with Proxmox. Let's unlock the full potential of our homelabs and enhance our IT skills together!

Thank you,</br>
